1
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,867
A witch! A witch!

2
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,771
A witch! We found a witch!

3
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,776
We've got a witch!
A witch! A witch!

4
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,409
Whoa there!

5
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:00,450
We have found a witch.
Maywe burn her?

6
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,560
- How do you know she is a witch?
- She looks like one.

7
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,597
Bring her forward.

8
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,193
I'm not a witch!
I'm not a witch!

9
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,330
But you are dressed as one.

10
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:18,204
- They dressed me like this.
- No, we didn't.

11
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,574
And this isn't my nose.
It's a false one.

12
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:24,482
Whoa there!

13
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:27,451
- Well?
- We did do the nose.

14
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:31,113
- The nose?
- And the hat. But she is a witch!

15
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:38,389
- Did you dress her up like this?
- No, no!

16
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:41,432
Yes. A bit.

17
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,865
She has got a wart.

18
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,994
What makes you think
she's a witch?

19
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,038
She turned me into a newt!

20
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:50,469
A newt?

21
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,206
I got better.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,214
Burn her anyway!

23
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:04,519
Quiet! Quiet!

24
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:07,922
There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

25
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:12,258
- Are there? What are they? Tell us.
- Do they hurt?

26
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,197
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

27
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,699
Burn them!

28
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:20,998
And what do you burn,
apart from witches?

29
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:24,405
- More witches!
- Wood!

30
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:27,444
So why do witches burn?

31
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:41,124
- 'Cause they're made of wood?
- Good!

32
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:49,226
- How do we tell if she is made ofwood?
- Build a bridge out ofher.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,963
But can you not also make bridges
out of stone?

34
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:55,371
Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,471
Does wood sink in water?

36
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:02,604
- No, it floats.
- Throw her into the pond!

37
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,951
What also floats in water?

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,284
- Bread.
- Apples.

39
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,483
- Very small rocks.
- Cider! Great gravy.

40
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,754
- Cherries. Mud.
- Churches.

41
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,762
- Lead.
- A duck!

42
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,498
Exactly.

43
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,960
So, logically--

44
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:30,906
If she weighs the same as a duck...

45
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,903
she's made of wood.

46
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,446
And therefore?

47
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,811
A witch!

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,984
- A duck! A duck!
- Here's a duck.

49
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,251
We shall use my largest scales.

50
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,433
Burn the witch!

51
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:12,146
Remove the supports!

52
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,453
A witch!

53
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,285
It's a fair cop.

54
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:27,953
Whoa there!

55
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:31,397
Who are you, who are so wise
in the ways of science?

56
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,937
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

57
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,064
My Liege!

58
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,802
Good Sir Knight, will you come with me
to Camelot...

59
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,606
and join us at the Round Table?

60
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:44,273
My Liege, I would be honored!

61
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:47,374
- What is your name?
- Bedevere, my Liege.

62
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:50,909
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere...

63
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:53,479
Knight of the Round Table.

64
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:58,257
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first
to join King Arthur's knights.

65
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:01,628
But other illustrious names
were soon to follow.

66
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,395
"Sir Lancelot the Brave.

67
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:07,164
Sir Galahad the Pure.

68
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:10,230
And Sir Robin the
Not-Quite-So-Brave-As Sir Lancelot...

69
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:12,503
who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor...

70
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,603
who nearly stoodup to
the Chicken of Bristol...

71
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,548
and wet himself at
the Battle of Badon Hill.

72
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:24,452
And the aptly named,
Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.

73
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:27,753
Together they formed a band
whose names and deeds...

74
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,316
were retold throughout the centuries. "

75
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,919
The Knights of the Round Table.

76
00:05:32,997 --> 00:00:00,000
And that, my Liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.
