00:00:55:06,00:00:56:06,Whoa there!
00:00:57:12,00:01:00:07,We have found a witch.|Maywe burn her?
00:01:03:04,00:01:06:08,- How do you know she is a witch?|- She looks like one.
00:01:08:04,00:01:10:09,Bring her forward.
00:01:10:10,00:01:13:03,I'm not a witch!|I'm not a witch!
00:01:13:04,00:01:15:05,But you are dressed as one.
00:01:15:06,00:01:18:03,- They dressed me like this.|- No, we didn't.
00:01:18:04,00:01:20:09,And this isn't my nose.|It's a false one.
00:01:24:06,00:01:24:07,Whoa there!
00:01:24:07,00:01:27:07,- Well?|- We did do the nose.
00:01:27:08,00:01:31:02,- The nose?|- And the hat. But she is a witch!
00:01:34:11,00:01:38:06,- Did you dress her up like this?|- No, no!
00:01:38:07,00:01:41:06,Yes. A bit.
00:01:41:07,00:01:43:13,She has got a wart.
00:01:43:14,00:01:45:15,What makes you think|she's a witch?
00:01:46:01,00:01:48:01,She turned me into a newt!
00:01:49:03,00:01:50:07,A newt?
00:01:54:09,00:01:56:03,I got better.
00:01:56:04,00:01:58:03,Burn her anyway!
00:02:01:10,00:02:04:08,Quiet! Quiet!
00:02:04:09,00:02:07:14,There are ways of telling|whether she is a witch.
00:02:07:15,00:02:12:04,- Are there? What are they? Tell us.|- Do they hurt?
00:02:12:05,00:02:15:03,Tell me, what do you do with witches?
00:02:15:04,00:02:16:10,Burn them!
00:02:18:05,00:02:20:15,And what do you burn,|apart from witches?
00:02:21:01,00:02:24:06,- More witches!|- Wood!
00:02:24:07,00:02:27:07,So why do witches burn?
00:02:38:10,00:02:41:02,- 'Cause they're made of wood?|- Good!
00:02:44:01,00:02:49:03,- How do we tell if she is made ofwood?|- Build a bridge out ofher.
00:02:49:05,00:02:52:14,But can you not also make bridges|out of stone?
00:02:53:14,00:02:55:06,Oh, yeah.
00:02:56:04,00:02:59:07,Does wood sink in water?
00:02:59:08,00:03:02:09,- No, it floats.|- Throw her into the pond!
00:03:06:01,00:03:08:14,What also floats in water?
00:03:09:00,00:03:11:04,- Bread.|- Apples.
00:03:11:05,00:03:14:07,- Very small rocks.|- Cider! Great gravy.
00:03:14:08,00:03:16:11,- Cherries. Mud.|- Churches.
00:03:16:12,00:03:18:11,- Lead.|- A duck!
00:03:21:01,00:03:22:07,Exactly.
00:03:23:14,00:03:25:14,So, logically--
00:03:26:01,00:03:30:14,If she weighs the same as a duck...
00:03:33:05,00:03:34:14,she's made of wood.
00:03:34:15,00:03:36:07,And therefore?
00:03:38:08,00:03:39:12,A witch!
00:03:42:11,00:03:44:15,- A duck! A duck!|- Here's a duck.
00:03:45:01,00:03:47:04,We shall use my largest scales.
00:03:54:07,00:03:56:06,Burn the witch!
00:04:08:05,00:04:12:02,Remove the supports!
00:04:16:00,00:04:17:07,A witch!
00:04:17:08,00:04:19:04,It's a fair cop.

00:04:44:05,00:04:47:06,- What is your name?|- Bedevere, my Liege.
00:04:47:07,00:04:50:14,Then I dub you Sir Bedevere...

00:05:15:10,00:05:19:08,^Iand wet himself at|^Ithe Battle of Badon Hill.
00:05:19:09,00:05:24:07,^IAnd the aptly named,|^ISir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.
00:05:24:08,00:05:27:11,^ITogether they formed a band|^Iwhose names and deeds...
