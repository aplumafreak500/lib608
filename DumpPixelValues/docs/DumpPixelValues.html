<h2>DumpPixelValues filter (v.1.0) for AviSynth 2.5</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This DLL allows you to sample the colors from selected pixels for every
frame in a video source and output the data to a text or binary file.</p>
<p><b>NOTES:</b> This software is covered under the terms of the GPL.  It can
be downloaded <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/McPoodle43/Tools/DumpPixelValues.zip">here</a>
(complete with this documentation and source code), and the most-recent version 
can be found <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/McPoodle43/Tools/DumpPixelValues.html">here</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p><b>DumpPixelValues(clip, string <i>colorList</i>,
  string <i>coordinateList</i>[, string <i>filename</i>])</b></p>
<p>The function name is <code>DumpPixelValues</code>.  Make sure the file
  DumpPixelValues.dll is located somewhere where AviSynth can find it.</p>
<p><b>ColorList</b> is one or more of the letters <code>R</code>,
  <code>G</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>A</code> (for the Alpha channel), 
  <code>Y</code>, <code>U</code> or <code>V</code>.  RGB colors cannot be mixed
  with YUV colors.  Video must be in RGB32 format if you want RGBA colors, or
  in YUY2 format if you want YUV colors.</p>
<p><b>CoordinateList</b> is a comma-separated set of (x,y) coordinates, with
  no spaces.</p>
<p>The optional parameter <b>filename</b> is assumed to be
  "C:\\DumpPixelValues.log" if it is not supplied.  You must use two backslash
  characters for each backslash in the full path.  The file will <i>not</i> be
  deleted if it already exists, instead appending the data onto the end of the
  existing file.  <b>NOTE:</b> To use the special binary output mode,
  <b>filename</b> must end with the extension <code>.bin</code> (see below for
  details).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Text Output Mode</h3>
<p>The default output of the filter is designed to be easily readable by both
humans and programs.</p>
<p>Here is a sample AviSynth .avs script with text output:</p>
<p><table border="1">
<caption>example1.avs</caption>
<tr><td><pre>LoadPlugin("DumpPixelValues.dll")

DirectShowSource("test.mpg")
ConvertToYUY2()
DumpPixelValues("YUV", "(100,100),(300,200),(600,50)", "D:\\test\colors.log")</pre>
</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>And here is what the corresponding output would look like if test.mpg was
  a 1 second (30 frame) 720x480 still frame made up of three horizontal
  stripes: deep red (Y=59, U=111, V=177), medium blue (Y=116, U=167, V=95) and
  pale green (Y=219, U=126, V=125):</p>

<p>The first line of the output echoes the <b>colorList</b> and
  <b>coordinatesList</b> parameters.  The rest of the file consists of one line
  for each frame of the clip.  Data for each coordinate are separated by
  spaces, while the color values for a single coordinate are separated by
  slashes.  Values are in hexidecimal.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Binary Output Mode</h3>
<p>Currently, binary output is designed for one specific scenario: extracting
  closed caption information from visual VBI.  A number of video editing cards
  on the market are capable of transmitting VBI information (including closed
  captions) by including this data in the stream outputted from the card.  If
  this stream is instead saved as a file, it takes the form of a
  taller-than-usual image with the VBI visually encoded in the extra rows at
  the top.  For example, here are the first 35 rows and 12 frames of a video
  produced using one of these systems.  The VBI takes up the first 28 rows, and
  closed captions (Line 21) reside on row 28:</p>
<p><img src="VBI.gif" width="720" height="35"
  alt="Animated GIF of visual VBI" /></p>
<p>The captions are encoded as a series of 16 luminance (Y) bars.  These
  correspond to 16 bits, or two bytes per frame.  Here is the AVS script to
  extract the closed caption data from this video:</p>
<p><table border="1">
<caption>example2.avs</caption>
<tr><td><pre>LoadPlugin("DumpPixelValues.dll")

DirectShowSource("VBItest.mpg")
ConvertToYUY2()
DumpPixelValues("Y", "(475,28),(449,28),(422,28),(395,28),(368,28),(341,28),(314,28),(287,28),(691,28),(664,28),(637,28),(610,28),(583,28),(556,28),(529,28),(502,28)", "D:\\test\\VBItest.bin")</pre>
</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><b>ColorList</b> must be <code>Y</code>, <b>coordinatesList</b> must contain
  a multiple of 8 coordinates (exactly 16 for closed captions), and
  <b>filename</b> must have the extension <code>.bin</code>.  The x values in
  the coordinates above will probably capture closed captions for any
  VBI-capable video editing card, as long as the width is 720 pixels--only the
  y values will have to be changed based on the card.</p>
<p>Here is the output of the above video for the first 12 frames, as viewed by
  a hex editor:</p>
<p><table border="1">
<caption>D:\test\VBItest.bin (hex editor)</caption>
<tr><td><pre>000000</pre></td>
<td><pre>FF FF FF FF CD D9 D3 45  4C 46 20 C1 CE C4 20 49</pre></td>
<td><pre>ÿÿÿÿÍÙÓELF ÁÎÄ I</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>000010</pre></td>
<td><pre>20 80 91 37 91 37 94 2C  94 2C 94 2F</pre></td>
<td><pre> €‘7‘7”,”,”/</pre></td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>The first four bytes are the broadcast raw caption header
<code>ff ff ff ff</code>.  This is followed by two bytes for each frame.  The
bytes are constructed by taking the Y values and converting them into 1 bits
if they are greater than 64 (hex 40) or 0 bits if they are less.</p>
<p>For example, the Y values for the first frame were 6b, 6e, 10, 10, 6e, 6d,
10, 6c, 6c, 6d, 11, 70, 6e, 0f, 12 and 6a.  This was translated into
11001101 11011001 binary, or CD D9 hex.</p>
<p>The file output by this process can be converted into the SCC format used by
high-end DVD authoring tools by use of the RAW2SCC program in the <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/McPoodle43/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_TOOLS.HTML">SCC_TOOLS</a>
suite of tools (shameless self-plug).</p>
<hr />
<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>The program is currently very slow, taking six minutes to process a thirty
second MPEG-2 file in binary output mode.  What will happen when you run your
AVS script through Windows Media Player will be the sound playing at normal
speed, with the video lagging far behind (I only saw three different frames
with my 30 second MPEG).  After the sound has finished, the processing will not
be complete (the progress bar will still read 100% instead of resetting to the
first frame as it usually does).  You must be patient and wait until the
program is completely finished--if you close WMP before the progress bar resets,
you will only get the output for the beginning of the file instead of the whole
thing.</p>
<p>The only time you should be worried is if the frames appearing in WMP
are garbage.  I had this in the case of my 720x512 MPEG-2 file (the normal
codecs, as well as the MPEG2DEC and MPEGDecoder dll's, could not handle the
abnormal frame size)--I found that installing the Elecard MPEG decoders and
changing the AVS to use DirectShowSource() instead of of the MPEGSource()
fixed this problem.</p>
<p>The second "problem" is that the colors are not the same exact values I used
to create them.  Considering how straightforward it is to extract colors from
AviSynth, I can only assume that the discrepancy is the result of the
compression used for each source file.</p>
